Ok gud we are done with enrollment part now

Now we have to develop the @ExamForm.tsx In the image, you can see how the page looks like in the corresponding website, but we're building a react-native app right using cli so we'll keep the URNNO and Student Name which coudlnt be edited Then a dropdown button for Class Name I've provided the necessary api details in apiDetailsExam.txt and the apis are defined in @examination.ts and the some imp hooks are defined in @useExamForm.tsx  Now after plz analyse the image properly to undersatnd how professinoally and creatively and user friendly you can show it in our app, build the best frontend with no duplicacy of lines of codes, you can use the components @DropdownField.tsx or @InputField.tsx or @DatePickerField.tsx if you want or even define your own new components. We have somme immp hooks already but its fine if you define more

Also analyse the store and authSlice as we are already storing some of the things which we may need in some api calls so we could directly use them

A And ofc we'll need to define some more interfaces or types in @ExamForm.types.ts  Also to not make the @ExamForm.tsx file much bigger, we can define helper functions in @examFormHelpers.ts  Plz analyse the instructions, api details and flow, think everything and give me clean, complete codes for the files so the Exam Form thing works in our app 

Analyse everything properly and make sure you write the code in the same formatting i've written in the files im contexting rn so to maintain the understandability

Make sure everything works in first go
